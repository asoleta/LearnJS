# Learning Javascript
## Welcome to my repository containing projects to help me learn Javascript!

After learning the fundamentals of Javascript via codeacademy, I wanted to learn more about the application of Javascript through projects. 
I found a YouTube playlist containing 30 days worth of Javascript projects. My goal is to work through all of these projects to further my understanding of Javascript.

As an additional challenge, I want to try to modify the tutorial code to implement other functionalities to help me practice the information I learned through the tutorial. 

Check out the projects I have completed by visiting the other branches!
